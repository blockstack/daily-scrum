# Daily Scrum

Every day we create an issue and post what we're working on for the day.

We list dates as "Tue, June 13, 2017". 

For the scrum, please first quickly review what actually happened the day before (sometimes what you intended to work on and what you ended up working on might not be the same) as it's a good way to measure progress towards the weekly sprint.

When listing what you're working on today, please try and be concise and focus on the most important/critical things especially as they relate to the weekly sprint. Feel free to link to Github issues and locations with more details.
